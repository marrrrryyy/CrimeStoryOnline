<h1>
    Mr Bloomington: “Good evening, detective. I am busy preparing the funeral, so I don’t have much time.
    What is it that you want to ask me?”
    
</h1>
<h3>
    Where were you at around 12 o’ clock?
</h3>
<h5>
Mr Bloomington: “I already told my story! I was walking in the park.

It is nearby so now and then I walk there and then I sit there on a bench, feed some ducks and watch over the lake.

I like it to be silent so I go to a place that is not often visited. Not even around lunch time! I guess that’s why no one could have seen me.”
</h5>
<h3>
We heard that you had a lot of fights with Mrs Bloomington. What was it all about?
</h3>
<h5>
Mr Bloomington: “You heard that from my kids? Yeah, our marriage wasn’t like it used to be.

Especially not after I found out that she had an affair with one of my friends!

It was a few years ago but I still can’t get over it!”
</h5>
<h3>
How did you find Mrs Bloomington?
</h3>
<h5>
Mr Bloomington: “When I came back from the walk. I came in from the back and into the living room. There I found her with A LOT of blood.

I didn’t know what to do and I honestly can’t remember clearly what I did then. I just know that I checked for a pulse and called 911. But I don’t know what I told them.

I just know that I realized pretty quickly that I lost her and that I regret that the last thing we did together was fighting.“
