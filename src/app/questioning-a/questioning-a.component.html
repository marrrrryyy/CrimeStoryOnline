            It is nearby so now and then I walk there and then I sit there on a bench, feed some ducks and watch over the lake.

            I like it to be silent so I go to a place that is not often visited. Not even around lunch time! I guess that’s why no one could have seen me.”

        Mr Bloomington: “When I came back from the walk. I came in from the back and into the living room. There I found her with A LOT of blood.
        <br>
        <br>
        I didn’t know what to do and I honestly can’t remember clearly what I did then. I just know that I checked for a pulse and called 911. But I don’t know what I told them.
        <br>
        <br>
        I just know that I realized pretty quickly that I lost her and that I regret that the last thing we did together was fighting.“
