    The victim is Mrs Bloomington, a 72 year old married woman. She is found dead in her living room and there was a great amount of blood coming from her head. 

    One of the windows of the living room was broken and shattered glass was everywhere around the victim together with a broken wine glass.

    The backdoor, that leads into the backyard, was open but no signs of a burglary were found. We found a great amount of white powder around the flower garden and a trail of ground coming from the backyard into the living room.
