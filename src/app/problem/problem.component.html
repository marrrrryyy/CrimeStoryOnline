    Partner: “Detective, are you done with reading all the information? Good timing! We just got a message from the research lab.
    <br>
    <br>
    They received a lot of things to inspect from the crime scene. There might have been a mistake and it is possible that they received something that wasn’t part of our crime scene.
    <br>
    <br>
    Would you look at the pictures from the crime scene and compare it to the list we got from the lab?
    <br>
    <br>
    Let me know if you find the item that doesn't belong to our crime scene!”
