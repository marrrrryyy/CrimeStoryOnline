    Partner: “The lab finished it’s research. Ready to know what they found? Here is the report.
    <br>
    <br>
    On the murder weapon was not only DNA found of the victim but also of an animal. It is cat hair that they found. From the Snowshoe cat breed.
    <br>
    <br>
    I think we have enough information and proof to arrest one of the suspects. Which one should we arrest?
    <br>
    <br>
    You can take a look at the summary first. For the arrest we have to know how the victim was murdered and why.
    <br>
    <br>
    If you know the answers we can continue.”
