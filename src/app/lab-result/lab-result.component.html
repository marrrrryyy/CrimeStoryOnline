    Partner: “The lab finished it’s research. Ready to know what they found? Here is the report.

    On the murder weapon was not only DNA found of the victim but also of an animal. It is cat hair that they found. From the Snowshoe cat breed.
    
    I think we have enough information and proof to arrest one of the suspects. Which one should we arrest?
    
    You can take a look at the summary first. For the arrest we have to know how the victim was murdered and why.
    
    If you know the answers we can continue.”
